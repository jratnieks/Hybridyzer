# GPU users (RAPIDS/cuDF/cuML):
# Prefer the conda env in environment.runpod.yml. Do not pip-install pyarrow/numpy
# into that env; use the pinned conda packages to avoid binary incompatibilities.
# RAPIDS for GPU acceleration (required for training, works in WSL/Linux with GPU passthrough)
# Install via conda: conda install -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia cudf-cu12 cuml-cu12 cupy-cuda12x
# Or via pip (Linux/WSL only): pip install cudf-cu12 cuml-cu12 cupy-cuda12x
# Note: cuML replaces LightGBM for GPU-accelerated training
